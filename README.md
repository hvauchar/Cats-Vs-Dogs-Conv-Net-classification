### Cats-Vs-Dogs-Conv-Net-classification
In this project, my task was to develop an algorithm to classify images of dogs and cats, which is the Dogs vs. Cats competition from Kaggle. I used Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to learn features of images and trained them via Backpropagation(BP)
